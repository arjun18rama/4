# Troubleshooting Build Failures

## Why does this happen?
Builds can fail for several reasons. The most common causes are:

- The language or package manager used by your application is not supported by the build environment.
- The application is missing required dependencies.
- The configuration contains errors that cause the build process to fail.

Verify your language and package manager are supported, install all dependencies, and double-check your configuration files to resolve these issues.
